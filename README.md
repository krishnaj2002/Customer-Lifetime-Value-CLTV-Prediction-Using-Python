### **Project Title:**  
**Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Prediction Using Python**  

### **Project Overview:**  
This project aims to predict **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** by analyzing transaction data and identifying key customer segments. The dataset contains **41,98,786 transactions**, including customer purchases, product details, and pricing information. The objective is to help businesses estimate long-term customer value, optimize marketing efforts, and improve customer retention strategies.  

### **Project Workflow:**  

#### **1. Data Preprocessing**  
- Loaded and cleaned the dataset by handling missing values and removing duplicate records.  
- Converted the date column into a proper datetime format for time-based analysis.  
- Filtered out transactions with negative or zero quantities to ensure data consistency.  

#### **2. Feature Engineering**  
- Created a new column to calculate the total revenue per transaction by multiplying quantity and unit price.  
- Aggregated customer-level data to determine total spending, frequency of purchases, and the time since the last transaction.  

#### **3. Customer Segmentation**  
- Conducted customer segmentation based on purchasing behavior using recency, frequency, and monetary value.  
- Identified high-value customers and those requiring engagement strategies.  

#### **4. CLV Prediction**  
- Developed a model to estimate the total revenue expected from each customer over a given period.  
- Analyzed historical purchasing patterns to make future value predictions.  
- Evaluated the accuracy of predictions using appropriate performance metrics.  

#### **5. Data Visualization and Insights**  
- Created visual dashboards to present customer spending trends and revenue distribution.  
- Generated insights on customer segments, high-value clients, and potential marketing strategies.  
- Provided recommendations for increasing customer retention and maximizing revenue.  

### **Outcome and Business Impact**  
- The project provides a data-driven approach to identifying and retaining profitable customers.  
- Helps businesses allocate resources efficiently by focusing on high-value customer segments.  
- Supports marketing teams in developing targeted campaigns for different customer groups.  

This analysis enables businesses to enhance customer relationships and drive long-term profitability through strategic decision-making.
